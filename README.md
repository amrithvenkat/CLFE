# CLFE
A trial with OOP concepts with C++


*************************************

Run the program with a standard C++ or g++ compiler on any platform. 

$ g++ -o final.exe main.cpp base.cpp element.cpp node.cpp profile.cpp f_profile.cpp

$ ./final.exe 

Update the coordinatesystem.docx to your respective profile and combinations.
Refer the explantation.pdf for more details into the structure of the program or the structure of the solid shape in consideration.

Standard profile details taken from the engineers handbook - Wendehorst-Bautechnische Zahlentafeln under the section Stahlbau.

Output.log contains the execution of the program and it's output. Make changes in base.cpp to give a custom output log file name.

If you encounter a Segmentation error, check the heap memory allocations are cleared using the delete keyword for all new instances created.
